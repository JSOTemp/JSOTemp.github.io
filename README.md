# [Julia Smooth Optimizers](https://JuliaSmoothOptimizers.github.io)

Here you will find a collection of Julia packages for Nonlinear Optimization.
These packages provides all the tools needed for creating optimization problems,
and optimization methods.
Eventually, we'll provide pure Julia implementations of Large-Scale robust
methods.
